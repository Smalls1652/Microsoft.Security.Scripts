# Scripts for Microsoft security actions

This repo contains my personal PowerShell scripts for performing actions on Microsoft products in response to security incidents. The main purpose of all of the scripts is to reduce the amount of manual work needed to perform them (Such as confirming multiple users as compromised).

## üíª Scripts

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Note:**
> 
> I'm currently in the process of making all of the scripts, so not all of them are available and there's no documentation for them yet.

All of the scripts are located in the [`Scripts/`](./Scripts/) directory and are separated based on the entity they target.
